# Use

The code in this directory is inspired by [this](https://github.com/saket/swipe/tree/trunk)


However, this version of the Swipe action only supports the left side swipe and locks on swipe. 
This also instead of rendering the Actions on top of the other element this renders them next to each other


The Element is also using a Card to give it a more of a continuous item look.
